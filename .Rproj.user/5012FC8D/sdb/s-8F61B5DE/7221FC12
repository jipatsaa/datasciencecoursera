Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.\n\nThe sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. \n\nThe data is spreaded out in several files and folders (test and train folders), in such a way that for each observation we know which-subject, the-signals-captured (561 signals), the-activity-performed, but all these informations have been stored separatelly, so they have to be merged before attempting any analysis.\n\n#### THE GOAL OF THE ORIGINAL DATA\nThis data was created to perform machine learning experiments on it. In this case, given a subject and preprocessed signals associated to his movements, guess the activity (WALKING, LAYING...) of the subject.\n\n### THE PROCESSED DATA\n\n The present data shows the mean values of the Mean and Standard deviation features (86 from the original 561) from original dataset for each subject-activity pair. The rest of the information has been discarded. \n \n#### FORMAT OF THE DATA\nEach row represents a subject-activity pair with the mean values of 86 different mean and standard deviation original values.\nNOTE: The first row corresponds to the names of the mean-features\n\nEach mean value appears in a different column\nNOTE: The first column corresponds to the subject id. (1 to 30)\n      The second column corrresponds to the activity descriptor (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)\n\n\n### GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTIVITY AND FEATURE CODES AND DESCRIPTORS\n1. (activity_labels.txt) file containing the activity codes and descriptors \n 6 activities in total\n- 1 WALKING\n- 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS\n- 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS\n- 4 SITTING\n- 5 STANDING\n- 6 LAYING\n\n2. (features.txt) file containing the descriptors of the movement features i.e. 1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X\n   561 features in total\n   \n### INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED TO EACH OBSERVATION OF A CERTAIN SUBJECT\nY_test.txt file contains inf. about the class to guess in the clustering task\n\n### INFORMATION ABOUT THE IDENTIFIERS OF THE SUBJECTS\nsubject_train.txt file in the train folder contains the identifiers of the 21 subjects appearing in the training set: 1  3  5  6  7  8 11 14 15 16 17 19 21 22 23 25 26 27 28 29 30\nsubject_test.txt file contains the identifiers of the 9 subjects appearing in the test set: 2  4  9 10 12 13 18 20 24\n\n### INFORMATION ABOUT THE MOVEMENTS OF THE SUBJECTS (divided in test and training sets/folders)\nX_test.txt and X_train.txt contain the information about the processed sensor signals\n  \n  1. TEST:  dim=number of observations (Subject-activity pairs): 2947, number of processed movement features for each Subject-activity pair: 561\n  \n  2. TRAIN: dim=number of observations (Subject-activity pairs): 7351, number of processed movement features for each Subject-activity pair: 561\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
